## About me

I have been immersed in the field of IT since **1996**, embarking on a journey that has taken me across the globe. Fluent in **English, Portuguese, Italian** and possessing a good understanding of **Spanish**, my language skills and professional journey working in large and medium-sized corporate businesses in **Brazil, Italy, and the UK** have proven invaluable throughout my career.

## Profile

As a **Solutions IT Architect**, I specialize in aligning business objectives with tailored technology solutions by leveraging software, hardware, and infrastructure strategies. I evaluate organizational requirements to design and implement scalable, secure, and cost-effective IT architectures that drive operational efficiency and business growth.

I lead end-to-end delivery of complex infrastructure initiatives—from strategic planning and architecture design through implementation and operational handover. I act as a key interface between internal stakeholders, clients, and third-party vendors to ensure seamless integration, adherence to best practices, and full compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

With a strong foundation in enterprise IT environments, particularly within high-pressure, complex SME settings, I bring a wealth of hands-on technical expertise coupled with strategic oversight. My approach emphasizes robust, resilient, and secure infrastructure design, underpinned by a commitment to quality and performance.

I am a results-driven IT professional with a passion for technology and a proven ability to deliver enterprise-grade infrastructure services. Backed by relevant certifications and extensive practical experience, I combine strong leadership, cross-functional collaboration, and project management capabilities with excellent communication and problem-solving skills. Adaptable and customer-focused, I thrive in dynamic environments and consistently meet tight deadlines and critical deliverables.
